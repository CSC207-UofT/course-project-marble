* A new user would like to use the financial banking app to send his friend (who already has an account) money:

  He downloads the app and needs to create a new user account. He fills in his personal information such as his 
  full name and sets up his username (unique to him) and password. Now he successfully has his own account. 
  He opens the list of transactions he can perform with his money, where e-transfer is one of the possible 
  transactions. He fills in his friend’s name and email address. Since his friend has an account as well, 
  it’s possible to send him money. The user enters the amount he wishes to send (given he has enough money), 
  reads the terms and conditions, makes final reviews and sends the amount. His bank account automatically deducts 
  the sent amount and records the latest transaction. He is then sent to the main home page where he decides to 
  close the app.
 
 
* An existing user would like to track his investments, assets and loans:

    The existing user logins to his account using his username and password previously created. He logs into his 
    account where his savings and checking account is there. In the accounts setting, he chooses to create a new portofolio 
    type account to record all his stocks. He enters what he currently holds into the fields of current holdings. 
    Afterwards, in the list of options he can perform to his newly created portfolio account, he decides to record his 
    student debt in the liability field. Lastly, he decides to record his watch value in the assets field because he wants 
    to sell it in the near future. The user has completed all records he wanted to make in the portfolio account. He wants 
    to know his own net worth, which is displayed on the home page of and, this is the accumulation of all his accounts. 
    He is satisfied and quits the app.
