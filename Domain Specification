Domain: Banking + Financial Planning App

Specification:
  Running the project initiates a prompt that allows the user to create an account or login to an existing account. 
  Each user has financial accounts (i.e savings and chequing), budget, and a total balance. Both types of financial 
  accounts have a transaction history, where a user can see transactions made on those accounts 
  (transactions themselves have a date, amount, and type of transaction). 
  Each user also has a monthly limit where the user is limited on the amount of money they can withdraw over a certain 
  period of time. Users can see how much interest they accumulate over x number of years based on compound interest 
  for the savings account. Users are able to record debt and see the projected growth of their investments based on 
  their investment’s performance history. Given all of this information, the user is able to select a prompt that 
  will allow them to perform a specific banking need. Some examples of this are checking their balance, deposit, 
  withdraw, transfer money, view their accounts, and view transaction history. These actions will be recorded and 
  the users accounts will be updated accordingly. 

Input:
b - check balance
d - deposit money
h - get transaction history
t - transfer money to someone else’s account
v - view your accounts
w - withdraw money
q - quit
