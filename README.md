Running Instructions: Server must be running before ClientUserInterface is run. Program uses Java.net and Java.io. The IP in ClientUserInterface is currently set to 127.0.0.1 but the program will run over the internet remotely as well. If it is being run over the internet the port 8000 may need to be forwarded to the machine the server is running on to get it to work
